# reddit-client
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) full stack engineer path portfolio project.

For this project, you will build an application for Reddit using everything youâ€™ve learned, including React and Redux. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

## Project Requirements:
- Build the application using React and Redux
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
  - Wireframes
  - Technologies used
  - Features
  - Future work
- Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme
- Write end-to-end tests for your application
- Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
- Users can use the application on any modern browser
- Users can access your application at a URL
- Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
- Users can search the data using terms
- Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined
- Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item
- Users are delighted with a cohesive design system
- Users are delighted with animations and transitions
- Users are able to leave an error state
- Get 90+ scores on [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/)
  - We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
- OPTIONAL: [Get a custom domain name and use it for your application](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/setting-up-your-domain/)
- OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
- OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app

### Prerequisites:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Jest and Selenium
- Git and GitHub
- Command line and file navigation
- Wireframing

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
